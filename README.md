Assignment
======================
A GUI based flight search program.

## Description
The program uses google flights information and collect the required information for the flights. The inputs are complete names of cities
to be travelled. The GUI contains a list box that helps user in writing the correct name. The list box only shows the correct name,
that cannot be selected from the list. The FULL NAMES ARE REQUIRED TO BE ENTERED MANNUALLY.



## Executable
I have created a executable .exe program from my python source code using pyinstaller. It is available in the Exectable/GUI.
The name of the executable is GUI.exe. Please run and allow the required access to the file.
All the dependencies are present and will run smoothly on any windows machine but will require network access. Kindly provide
the reqired network access, thus allowing the program to run.

When running the program, after entering the cities and search , the window will become 'Not Responding', please do not panic as it is the
drawback of my program but it wont effect the result.The resultswill be displaed in a selectable table with a book button, just select 
the flight of your choice and it will be transfered to the BOOKED table in the database.The results will be stored in Flights.db, which can 
be viewed in any database viewing program.

## Source
Source containts the original python code which is also executable but will require dependencies to be install. All the codes are 
well structured and documented and will be easy to understand.
